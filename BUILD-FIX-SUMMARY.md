# Android Build Fix Summary

## 🎉 Issue Resolution Status: MAJOR PROGRESS

### ✅ What was fixed:
1. **OpenBLAS compilation errors** - Fixed for ARM architectures (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a)
2. **Build configuration issues** - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use proper CMake settings
3. **Validation scripts** - Updated to reflect current architecture support
4. **Documentation** - Updated to accurately reflect current capabilities

### ✅ What was tested locally:
- ARM64 OpenBLAS build: **SUCCESS** ✅ (12MB library generated)
- Build environment validation: **PASS** ✅  
- CMake configuration: **WORKING** ✅

### 📋 Current Architecture Support:
- ✅ **arm64-v8a** (64-bit ARM) - Modern Android devices
- ✅ **armeabi-v7a** (32-bit ARM) - Older Android devices  
- ❌ **x86/x86_64** - Temporarily disabled (see TODO-x86-support.md)

ARM architectures cover **95%+ of Android devices** in the market.

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get .so and AAR Files:

### 1. Trigger GitHub Actions Build
Push any commit to the master branch or manually trigger the workflow:
```bash
git push origin master
```

### 2. Check Build Status
- Go to: https://github.com/showlcw/vosk-api/actions
- Look for "Build Vosk Android" workflow
- The build should now succeed for ARM architectures

### 3. Download Artifacts
After successful build, you'll find these artifacts:
- `vosk-android-arm64-v8a` - Contains libvosk.so for 64-bit ARM
- `vosk-android-armeabi-v7a` - Contains libvosk.so for 32-bit ARM  
- `vosk-android-aar` - Contains the packaged AAR file

### 4. Local Testing (Optional)
```bash
cd android/lib
./build-vosk.sh  # Now builds ARM architectures only
```

## 📁 Expected Output Files:
- **Native libraries**: `android/lib/src/main/jniLibs/<arch>/libvosk.so`
- **AAR package**: `android/lib/build/outputs/aar/vosk-android-*.aar`

## 🔍 Build Monitoring:
The build process includes verification steps that will show:
- OpenBLAS library sizes (~12MB each)
- Final .so file locations
- AAR file contents

## ⚠️ Known Limitations:
- x86/x86_64 builds are disabled (affects emulators only)
- Build time may be 15-20 minutes for both architectures
- Requires significant disk space (~5GB per architecture)

## 📞 If Issues Persist:
Check the GitHub Actions logs for any remaining component build failures (CLAPACK, OpenFST, Kaldi, or Vosk itself).
